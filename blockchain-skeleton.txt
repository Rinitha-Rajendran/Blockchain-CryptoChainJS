Code Explanation:

Block Class:
    Constructor: Initializes the block with an index, timestamp, data, previous hash, and computes its hash.

    calculateHash Method: Generates a SHA256 hash based on the block's properties.

BlockChain Class:

    Constructor: Initializes the blockchain and adds the genesis block.

    createGenesisBlock Method: Creates the first block of the blockchain with a predetermined index and previous hash.

    getLatestBlock Method: Returns the last block in the chain.

    addBlock Method: Adds a new block to the chain after setting its previous hash and calculating its hash.

    isChainValid Method: Validates the blockchain by checking the hashes of each block and their relationships to ensure the chain's integrity.

Example Usage:

    At the end of the script, thereâ€™s an example of how to create a blockchain instance, add blocks, and check if the blockchain is valid.
